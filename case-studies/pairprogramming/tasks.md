# Tasks
In this exercise, you're expected to quasi-pair-program with one of the interviewers. You're free to ask any questions, ask for help, guidance, recommendations, anything that you would ask from a peer while coding (you can even ask for intervention too). You're not going to be evaluated so much on the end result, but more on the way you work your way through.

Your main task is to sort a generated dataset, and test (and prove) if the sorting worked. The main process is in: [test.js](test.js)

As a warmup, you'll have 3 simple tasks to complete first, and then work out the rest until you think you've proven that the sorting works. 

### Important note:
_The code is ridden with bugs, technical and code mistakes and maybe stylistic errors too. You can go ahead and fix or pinpoint and work around these errors as you go along._

## 1. Bounded random
Implement a bounded random integer generator function in
[just.js](just.js).

## 2. Assertion fn
Implement a basic assertion function in 
[assert.js](assert.js).

## 3. SleepSort alg
Implement the sleepSort algorithm in 
[sleepSort.js](sleepSort.js).

## Main: Testing the program
Prove that the sorting works by working on [test.js](test.js). If you think it'd fit in time, you can set up proper testing with `jest` or tools you like, but proving that it works don't require these tools necessarily.
