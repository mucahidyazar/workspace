## Description

After long studies I decide to study again to CSS from zero. And I bought 2 CSS courses on Udemy. This is Jonas Schmedtmann's course. I will drop here his course's link. I prefer to everyone. I learn lots of thing. And his this course have 3 big projects that ara Natours, Trillo and Nexter. But I built some different from him. He designed with html and scss but I used React for his project. I mean I created lots of Components and connection for this project. And there are some different modules to convert and prefix to scss file. Concat for combine, Autoprefixer for prefix, npm-run-all for starting to all processes together, postcss-cli for converting from scss to css
