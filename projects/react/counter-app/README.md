<!-- ### Simple

Counter--app was made by me - a simple, plain-text clicker app for the web with Github support. What you see is what you paste. No WYSIWIG, no formatting pasted from the web, and no features you don't need or want.

### Organized

Drag-and-drop notes into categories, instantly search through notes, and pin your favorites to the top.

### Beautiful

Beautiful, clean design with light and dark themes.

### Sync to GitHub

In progress! -->

<!-- ## Reviews 

> _"I think the lack of extra crap is a feature."_ â€” Craig Lam-->

## Description

This was mine first application that I built by myself after lot of courses. I only used React for this project.

### NPM Packages
I only used create-react-app boilerplate

## Setup

### Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mucahidyazar/counter-app
cd counter-app
npm i or yarn
```

<!-- ### Development

In the development environment, an Express server is running on port `5000` to handle all API calls, and a hot Webpack dev server is running on port `3000` for the React front end. To run both of these servers concurrently, run the `dev` command.

```bash
# Run client and server concurrently
npm run dev
```

Go to `localhost:3000` to view the app.

API requests will be proxied to port `5000` automatically. -->

### Production

<!-- In production, the React app is built, and Express redirects all incoming requests to the `dist` directory on port `5000`. -->

```bash
# Build client for production and start server
# npm run build &&
npm run start
```

Go to `localhost:5000` to view the app.

<!-- ### Run in Docker

Docker containers are [also available on the Dockerhub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/taniarascia/takenote).

```bash
docker build -t takenote .
docker run -p 5000:5000 takenote
# Go to localhost:5000 to view the application
```

### Seed data

To seed the app with some test data, paste the contents of `seed.js` into your browser console.

## Testing

Run unit and component tests.

```bash
npm run test
```

Run Cypress e2e tests.

```bash
npm run cypress:open
``` -->
