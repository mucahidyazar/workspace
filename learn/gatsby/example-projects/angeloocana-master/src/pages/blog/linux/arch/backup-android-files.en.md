Is your Android mobile FULL? Backup your data to your Arch Linux.
It is easy following my steps (I hope hahaha).
I had some trouble with other programs (android-file-transfer e mtpfs),
so here it goes what works for me:


## Install simple-mtpfs
If you do not have or know what is **Yaourt**, please check it out:
https://angeloocana.com/en/blog/linux/arch/install-yaourt/

```bash
    yaourt -S simple-mtpfs
```

## Create destination folder
I'll be using **mnt** folder, you can use any name, but remember it for the next step.
```bash
    mkdir ~/mnt
```

## Mount your Phone to a folder
```bash
    simple-mtpfs --device 1 ~/mnt
```

That is it! uhuhuh
Just go to **~/mnt**, your files will be there!
